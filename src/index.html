      <h2 id="sec01header">Disabilities in the United States</h2>
      <p>
        The 2021 American Community Survey by the Census Bureau reported 13% of all Americans
        have a non-institutionalized disability. Of the roughly 38,903,887 adults with a disability in the
        United States, 19.7% of them live below the poverty line. This is almost double the number of
        adults in the United States who are below the poverty line. This is partially due to lower rates of
        employment for disabled people. In the United States, 25.9% of disabled people over the age of
        16 are employed in the civilian sector, while 59.6% of all US citizens over 16 are employed in
        the same sector.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comparing the breakdown of disability between my current state of residence, Utah, and the
        United States, Utah has a disabled population of 342,378 or 10.3% of the total population,
        compared to the United States which has 42,485,034 disabled people or 13.0% of the total
        population. Table 1: Disability Type by Gender for Utah and the United States shows the
        disparities between genders and types of disabilities.

      <p>
        There are a few reasons why these disparities exist; however, that is not a topic for this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to representation by race, there are some interesting differences between Utah
        and the United States. Table 2: Disability Percent by Race, you can see that Utah has a higher
        occurrence of disabilities in the Black or African American, American Indian and Alaska Natives,
        Native Hawai’ian and Other Pacific Islanders, and the Hispanic or Latino communities than the
        United States as a whole. However, for the White community in Utah, they have a lower
        occurrence of disability than the national rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we take into consideration the rates of disabilities in the United States (roughly 40
        million people) and Utah (roughly 350,000 people), we can understand the importance of
        building accessible experiences for all people.

      </p>
      <p>
        The power of the web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless is an essential aspect.

        This website applies the principles of Universal Design, as defined by Ronald Mace and his team: 
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Equitable Use</dt>
        <dd>The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities</dd>
        <dt>Flexibility in Use</dt>
        <dd>The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities</dd>
        <dt>Simple and Intuitive Use</dt>
        <dd>Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user’s experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level</dd>
        <dt>Perceptible Information</dt>
        <dd>The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user’s sensory abilities</dd>
        <dt>Tolerance for Error</dt>

        <dt>Low Physical Effort</dt>
        <dd>The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue</dd>
        <dt>Size and Space for Approach and Use</dt>
